- question: 'Is my model/model SM-G92xx supported?'
  answer: 'If the build is from the download-page, that ROM supports every single model, but some models, like the Sprint ones, need a custom system-image which we don''t provide... And no, The Edge+ is NOT supported by us. If it''s a build posted by us (most often by Lukas0610), it''s probably Flat (G920F)-ONLY'
