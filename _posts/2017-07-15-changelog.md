Many fixes: Auto-Brightness, ROM-Control and extreme power-saver
<!-- more -->

### Fixed/Improved

 * Fixed auto-brightness
 * Fixed force-closings in "The Nexus"
 * Fixed kernel-panic on enabling extreme power-saver: NexusOS is the only ROM which has proper support for both HW overlays and extreme power-saver,
   so HW overlays got disabled on ResurrectionRemix and AOKP which may result in lower performance in both ROMs. As always, we recommend to use NexusOS.
