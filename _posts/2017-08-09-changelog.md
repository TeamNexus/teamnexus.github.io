Google's August-patches, reworked kernel and Google Server-fix
<!-- more -->

### Fixed/Improved

  * Because of persisting performance and battery-issues, the kernel-versions was reverted to 3.10.61 as well many high-performance-enhancements which reduced battery-lifetime were removed
  * Patched kernel to Samsung-sources G920FXXS5EQG2
  * Included Google's August security-patches
  * Fixed non-working connection to Google Services (<a href="https://github.com/TeamNexus/android_build/commit/1538cf0bd9015e4051b37b6b95fc5aad15f421ed">TeamNexus/android_build@1538cf0</a>)
  
And many other things I probably already forgot about
